# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Dart: improper handling of exceptions in asynchronous operations.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from a remote API but lacks robust error handling, potentially leading to silent failures.

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version with complete try-catch blocks for all potential points of failure, ensuring the application gracefully handles errors and prevents unexpected crashes or data loss.

This is a practical example of how to use `try-catch` and `rethrow` effectively to enhance the reliability of asynchronous code in your Dart applications.
